        I had a busy day today and figured I'd share everything I did. As the saying goes: "early bird gets the worm" so at 6 a.m. I decided to start pawing at Valeria's face to give me food. You always have to make sure you can't see the bottom of the bowl. Then, I decided I wasn't actually hungry and went to sleep. I napped for most of the day before waking up and running around, eating, and going back to sleep. As Valeria was working on her project, I decided to begin my tried and true method of meowing and annoying her to give me more food... which I decided not to eat.

        In other news, I have so created an instagram since many of you have been asking. I don't know how often I will post on there, but you can follow me. I've added a link to the homepage. Let me know if you'd like to see me on any other social media platfforms.
